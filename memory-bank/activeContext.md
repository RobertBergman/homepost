# Active Context

_Current work focus, recent changes, next steps, active decisions, important patterns, and learnings._

## Current Focus
- Comprehensive code review to understand system architecture and components
- Analyzing server-side WebSocket communication and processing logic
- Understanding client-side audio capture and transmission mechanisms
- Examining React GUI architecture and state management
- Investigating LangChain/LangGraph workflow for AI processing
- Reviewing test coverage and quality
- Identifying security, performance, and improvement opportunities

## Recent Changes
- Completed full code review covering server, client, and GUI components
- Updated memory bank with detailed architectural insights
- Identified strengths in the codebase:
  - Robust error handling with graceful degradation
  - Efficient WebSocket communication with heartbeat monitoring
  - Well-structured database with indexes and optimizations
  - Modular LangGraph workflow for audio processing
  - Strong client-side resilience with reconnection logic
  - React GUI with clean component separation

## Next Steps
- Implement proper authentication and authorization system
- Enhance security through rate limiting and additional validation
- Improve error tracing with request IDs across components
- Extract LangChain workflow and WebSocket handlers into separate modules
- Add certificate validation for secure WebSocket connections
- Implement offline mode capabilities for client devices
- Enhance React GUI with accessibility improvements
- Add continuous integration with automated testing
- Create comprehensive API documentation

## Active Decisions
- Focus on security improvements as a priority
- Modularize the codebase further for maintainability
- Enhance client resilience with offline capabilities
- Consider TypeScript migration for improved type safety
- Implement proper metrics and monitoring
- Maintain cross-platform compatibility while improving robustness

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- LangGraph state-based workflow for AI processing
- WebSocket communication with heartbeat and reconnection logic
- Buffer-based audio processing with configurable parameters
- React Context API for state management
- Defensive configuration handling with fallbacks
- Structured logging with configurable levels
- SQLite with optimized configuration and indexes
- Retry mechanisms with exponential backoff

## Learnings and Insights
- Server architecture effectively separates concerns between database, API, WebSocket, and AI processing
- Client implements robust error handling and reconnection strategies
- React GUI effectively uses Context API for WebSocket state management
- LangGraph provides a clean, maintainable way to orchestrate AI workflows
- SQLite configuration demonstrates attention to performance details
- Error handling is comprehensive throughout the codebase
- Cross-platform considerations are well-addressed with specific patches

## Technical Strengths
- Robust configuration and environment validation
- Modular, extensible design with clear separation of concerns
- Effective use of modern libraries and frameworks
- Defensive coding practices throughout the codebase
- Real-time features with proper connection monitoring
- Good error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Comprehensive test coverage with proper mocking

## Technical Debt
- Authentication is placeholder and needs proper implementation
- Some components could benefit from further modularization
- Error tracing lacks request IDs across components
- Client lacks offline capabilities
- React GUI could benefit from accessibility improvements
- Documentation is incomplete, especially for API endpoints
