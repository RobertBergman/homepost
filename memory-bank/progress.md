## Current Status
The project has a solid foundation with working core functionality across server, client, and GUI components. Backend logic for WebSocket communication, audio processing, and AI integration is well-implemented. Client application demonstrates good resilience and audio handling. React GUI provides functional device monitoring and management. 

The codebase shows attention to error handling, performance optimization, and testing. It's currently in a mid-development phase, with key features working but requiring security hardening, refinement, and additional functionality before production readiness.

## Known Issues
- Authentication is placeholder and needs proper implementation
- WebSocket security could be enhanced
- Client lacks offline capabilities
- Error tracing is incomplete across components
- React GUI needs accessibility improvements
- Cross-platform audio handling has edge cases
- Documentation is incomplete
- No automated deployment pipeline
- Limited monitoring and metrics
- Some potential memory management issues in audio handling

## Evolution of Decisions
- Started with Express and WebSockets for real-time communication
- Integrated OpenAI for transcription and analysis
- Adopted LangChain and LangGraph for workflow orchestration
- Implemented SQLite with optimizations for data persistence
- Designed client with robust reconnection strategies
- Created React GUI with Context API for state management
- Established Jest testing framework with mocks
- Added Windows-specific patches for cross-platform support
- Implemented audio buffering with configurable parameters
- Set up alerts with AI analysis and keyword fallback

## Lessons Learned
- Real-time WebSocket communication requires careful connection monitoring
- Audio processing benefits from buffering and chunk-based handling
- LangGraph provides an elegant way to structure AI workflows
- React Context API works well for WebSocket state management
- SQLite with proper optimizations is sufficient for this use case
- Error handling requires consistent approaches across components
- Cross-platform support demands specific patches and configurations
- Exponential backoff improves reconnection reliability
- Testing with mocks is essential for external dependencies
- Configuration should be flexible with environment overrides
