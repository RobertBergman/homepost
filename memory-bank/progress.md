# Progress

_What works, what's left to build, current status, known issues, and evolution of project decisions._

## What Works
- Core backend and frontend scaffolding
- Initial OpenAI, LangChain, and LangGraph integration points
- WebSocket communication framework established
- Windows compatibility scripts created
- Basic automated tests with Jest and mocks

## What's Left
- Full AI assistant workflow integration
- Complete device management features
- Audio processing and TTS pipeline optimization
- Frontend UI/UX refinement
- Robust error handling and edge case coverage
- User authentication and authorization
- Deployment automation and documentation

## Current Status
The project is in an early-to-mid development phase with core frameworks in place. Key integrations and features are partially implemented, with significant work remaining to reach a production-ready state.

## Known Issues
- Cross-platform audio handling complexities
- Open questions around user auth and device onboarding
- Potential latency in AI response times
- Need for improved test coverage and CI integration

## Evolution of Decisions
- Chose OpenAI as primary AI provider early on
- Adopted LangChain and LangGraph to manage AI workflows
- Prioritized modular, cross-platform design
- Emphasized automated testing from the start

## Lessons Learned
- Early integration of AI workflows helps guide architecture
- Cross-platform support requires dedicated effort
- Real-time communication is critical and complex
- Modular design aids in parallel development

## Initial Notes
This progress snapshot is inferred from project structure and should be updated as development advances.
