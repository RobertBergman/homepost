# Product Context

_Why this project exists, the problems it solves, how it should work, and user experience goals._

## Purpose
HomePost exists to provide an AI-powered communication and device management platform that enables real-time audio processing, transcription, and alert detection. It creates a bridge between smart devices and users through natural language interfaces and a centralized monitoring dashboard.

## Problems Addressed
- Complexity of managing multiple smart devices across locations
- Need for real-time audio transcription and analysis 
- Alert detection and notification from voice inputs
- Fragmented monitoring of distributed devices
- Complexity of integrating AI capabilities with device management
- Cross-platform compatibility challenges, especially with audio
- Lack of centralized device status and transcription history

## User Personas
- **Home Users:** Individuals managing smart home devices who want voice-driven control and monitoring.
- **Security Monitors:** Personnel who need to detect emergency keywords and receive alerts.
- **Device Administrators:** IT staff deploying and maintaining a network of audio-enabled devices.
- **Developers:** Building extensions or integrations with the HomePost platform.

## User Experience Goals
- Enable natural voice interaction with immediate transcription feedback
- Provide real-time alert detection and notification from audio streams
- Present a centralized dashboard for device monitoring and management
- Support reliable audio capture and text-to-speech responses
- Ensure fault tolerance with reconnection mechanisms
- Maintain consistent performance across different platforms
- Offer intuitive configuration and device management

## Key Features
As evidenced in the codebase:
- Real-time audio capture and buffering with configurable parameters
- OpenAI-powered transcription via Whisper API
- AI analysis workflow using LangChain and LangGraph
