# Project Brief

_This is the foundation document that shapes all other memory bank files._

## Project Name
HomePost

## Overview
HomePost is a multi-component platform combining a Node.js backend and a React frontend to provide AI-powered communication, device management, and audio processing capabilities. It integrates with OpenAI APIs and leverages LangChain and LangGraph for advanced AI workflows.

## Core Requirements and Goals
- Enable AI assistant features using OpenAI models
- Support real-time communication via WebSockets
- Manage and interact with connected devices
- Process and synthesize audio, including TTS
- Provide a user-friendly web interface
- Support cross-platform deployment, including Windows
- Maintain modular, testable, and scalable architecture

## Scope
**In Scope:**
- Backend server with API endpoints and WebSocket support
- Frontend React application with device and AI interaction
- Integration with OpenAI, LangChain, LangGraph
- Audio processing and TTS features
- Device management and monitoring
- Cross-platform compatibility scripts

**Out of Scope:**
- Native mobile applications
- Hardware manufacturing
- Non-OpenAI AI model integrations (initially)

## Stakeholders
- End users seeking AI-powered communication and device control
- Developers extending or maintaining the platform
- System administrators deploying HomePost

## Success Criteria
- Seamless AI assistant integration
- Reliable real-time communication
- Intuitive user interface
- Stable device management
- Cross-platform operability
- High test coverage and maintainability

## Constraints
- Dependent on OpenAI API availability and limits
- Must support Windows environments
- Use of Node.js and React as core technologies
- Compliance with data privacy and security best practices

## Initial Notes
This brief is based on current project structure and inferred goals. It should be refined as more explicit requirements become available.
