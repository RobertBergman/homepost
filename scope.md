# Home Monitoring System with Raspberry Pi and AI Processing

## Overview

This project creates a home monitoring system using Raspberry Pi devices equipped with microphones and optionally webcams, placed throughout your house. Each Raspberry Pi captures audio (and video, if available) and streams it to a central server located in your home. The server processes the incoming data using LangChain and LangGraph, leveraging the OpenAI Realtime API for real-time transcription and analysis. A web-based graphical user interface (GUI), built with Node.js and React, allows you to interact with the system, view live transcriptions, and manage settings.

## System Architecture

The system consists of three main components:

- **Raspberry Pi Clients:**
  - Capture audio from microphones and optionally video from webcams.
  - Stream the captured data to the central server in real-time using WebSockets.

- **Central Server:**
  - Receives audio (and video) streams from multiple Raspberry Pi clients.
  - Processes audio streams using the OpenAI Realtime API for real-time transcription.
  - Uses LangChain and LangGraph to further analyze or act on the transcribed data (e.g., keyword detection, response generation).
  - Hosts a Node.js-based web server that serves the React GUI and provides API endpoints for user interaction.

- **Web GUI:**
  - A React application served by the Node.js server.
  - Displays live transcriptions and processed data from each Raspberry Pi.
  - Allows users to monitor devices, view historical data, and configure settings.

### Data Flow

1. Each Raspberry Pi captures audio (and video, if equipped with a webcam).
2. The data is streamed to the central server via WebSockets.
3. The server processes the audio using the OpenAI Realtime API to generate transcriptions.
4. LangChain and LangGraph process the transcriptions for additional analysis or actions.
5. Processed data is made available through the web GUI, which updates in real-time.

## Features

- **Real-Time Audio Processing:** Transcribes audio from microphones using the OpenAI Realtime API.
- **Video Support (Optional):** Processes video feeds from webcams if available.
- **AI-Powered Analysis:** Utilizes LangChain and LangGraph for customizable text processing workflows.
- **Interactive Web GUI:** Built with Node.js and React, offering a user-friendly interface to monitor and control the system.
- **Multi-Device Support:** Handles streams from multiple Raspberry Pi devices simultaneously.

## Installation

### Step 1: Set Up Raspberry Pi Clients

1. **Install Raspberry Pi OS:**
   - Flash the latest Raspberry Pi OS onto each device's SD card using Raspberry Pi Imager.
   - Boot the Raspberry Pi and complete the initial setup (e.g., configure Wi-Fi).

2. **Install Node.js:**
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install -y nodejs npm
   ```

3. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-folder>/client
   ```

4. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

5. **Configure the Client:**
   - Edit the `client.js` file to set the central server's IP address and port (e.g., `ws://192.168.1.100:3000`).

### Step 2: Set Up the Central Server

1. **Install OS and Dependencies:**
   - On your server machine, install a Linux OS (e.g., Ubuntu) if not already set up.
   - Install Node.js and npm:
     ```bash
     sudo apt update
     sudo apt install -y nodejs npm
     ```

2. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-folder>/server
   ```

3. **Install Server Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Build the React GUI:**
   ```bash
   cd gui
   npm install
   npm run build
   cd ..
   ```

5. **Set Environment Variables:**
   - Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory:
     ```plaintext
     OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-openai-api-key>
     PORT=3000
     ```
   - Replace `<your-openai-api-key>` with your OpenAI API key (obtained from OpenAI's website).

### Step 3: Run the System

1. **Start the Server:**
   ```bash
   cd <repository-folder>/server
   node server.js
   ```

2. **Start Each Raspberry Pi Client:**
   ```bash
   cd <repository-folder>/client
   node client.js
   ```

3. **Access the Web GUI:**
   - Open a browser on any device on the same network and navigate to `http://<server-ip>:3000` (e.g., `http://192.168.1.100:3000`).

## Configuration

- **API Keys:**
  - Ensure the `OPENAI_API_KEY` is correctly set in the server's `.env` file.
- **Raspberry Pi Identifiers:**
  - Assign a unique ID to each Raspberry Pi in the `client.js` configuration (e.g., `deviceId: "living-room"`).
- **Server Address:**
  - Update the WebSocket URL in each client's configuration to match the server's IP and port.
- **Custom Processing:**
  - Modify the LangChain and LangGraph workflows in `server.js` to customize how transcriptions are processed (e.g., detect specific keywords).

## Usage

1. **Access the Web GUI:**
   - Navigate to `http://<server-ip>:3000` in your browser.
   - Log in if authentication is enabled (default: no authentication; see "Security" section to add it).

2. **Monitor Devices:**
   - The dashboard displays live transcriptions from each Raspberry Pi.
   - Select a device (e.g., "Living Room") to view detailed data or toggle video feeds (if available).

3. **Configure Settings:**
   - Use the settings page to enable/disable devices, set up alerts for specific phrases (e.g., "Help"), or adjust processing options.

4. **View Historical Data:**
   - If configured, browse past transcriptions stored in the database via the GUI.

## Customization

- **Processing Workflows:**
  - Edit the `server.js` file to adjust LangChain and LangGraph pipelines. For example:
    - Extract entities: `langchain.extractEntities(transcription)`
    - Trigger actions: `if (transcription.includes("lights on")) { /* action */ }`
- **Web GUI:**
  - Modify the React components in the `gui/src` directory to add new features (e.g., a map of device locations).
- **Video Processing:**
  - Extend `client.js` and `server.js` to handle webcam streams using `node-webcam` and process frames with additional APIs.

## Security

- **Authentication:**
  - Add user authentication to the web GUI using a library like `passport.js` in the Node.js server.
  - Example: Implement JWT-based login by updating `server.js` and adding a login page in React.
- **Network Security:**
  - For local use only, no additional setup is required.
  - If exposing the GUI externally, configure HTTPS with a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx) and set up port forwarding or a VPN.
- **Data Protection:**
  - Ensure sensitive audio/video data is not stored unnecessarily; configure retention policies in the database.

## Troubleshooting

- **Clients Not Connecting:**
  - Verify the server's IP and port are correct in `client.js`.
  - Check network connectivity and ensure no firewall blocks port 3000.
- **No Transcriptions:**
  - Confirm the OpenAI API key is valid and the Realtime API is accessible.
  - Check server logs (`console.log` outputs in `server.js`) for errors.
- **GUI Not Loading:**
  - Ensure the React app is built (`npm run build`) and the server is running.

## Performance Considerations

- **Scalability:**
  - The system supports multiple Raspberry Pi devices, but performance may degrade with many simultaneous streams. Optimize WebSocket handling or upgrade server hardware if needed.
- **Latency:**
  - Minimize delays by ensuring a strong local network and efficient processing pipelines.
